## How to show your progress

1. At the top of this page, click "Use this template"
2. Commit your work or proof of completion to public repos and create links in the "Repository" field under the appropriate subject heading below.

The intention of this template is to provide students a way to track their progress through contributing to personal repositories. It may be a convenient way to show their progress through a public page for friends, family, employers, etc.
You can change the status of your personal repository to *public* or *private*.

If you are at the very start of your learning journey, it might be a good idea to make a note here of your goals, expectations, timelines etc. At the very least this will act as a good note to look back on at the end.

## Prerequisites

- [Core CS](#core-cs) assumes the student has already taken [high school math](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science/blob/master/FAQ.md#how-can-i-review-the-math-prerequisites), including algebra, geometry, and pre-calculus.
- [Advanced CS](#advanced-cs) assumes the student has already taken the entirety of Core CS
and is knowledgeable enough now to decide which electives to take.
- Note that [Advanced systems](#advanced-systems) assumes the student has taken a basic physics course (e.g. AP Physics in high school).

## Intro CS

### Introduction to Programming

If you've never written a for-loop, or don't know what a string is in programming, start here. This course is self-paced, allowing you to adjust the number of hours you spend per week to meet your needs.

**Topics covered**:
`simple programs`
`simple data structures`

### Introduction to Computer Science

This course will introduce you to the world of computer science. Students who have been introduced to programming, either from the courses above or through study elsewhere, should take this course for a flavor of the material to come. If you finish the course wanting more, Computer Science is likely for you!

## Final project

OSS University is project-focused.
The assignments and exams for each course are to prepare you to use your knowledge to solve real-world problems.

After you've gotten through all of Core CS and the parts of Advanced CS relevant to you, you should think about a problem that you can solve using the knowledge you've acquired.
Not only does real project work look great on a resume, but the project will also validate and consolidate your knowledge.
You can create something entirely new, or you can find an existing project that needs help via websites like
[CodeTriage](https://www.codetriage.com/)
or
[First Timers Only](https://www.firsttimersonly.com/).

Students who would like more guidance in creating a project may choose to use a series of project oriented courses. Here is a sample of options (many more are available, at this point you should be capable of identifying a series that is interesting and relevant to you):

### Evaluation


Project Evaluation | Completion Date | Repository
:-- | :--: | :--: 
[PROJECTS](PROJECTS.md) Pull-request or eval thread | | 


Solicit feedback from your OSSU peers.
You will not be "graded" in the traditional sense — everyone has their own measurements for what they consider a success.
The purpose of the evaluation is to act as your first announcement to the world that you are a computer scientist
and to get experience listening to feedback — both positive and negative.

The final project evaluation has a second purpose: to evaluate whether OSSU,
through its community and curriculum, is successful in its mission to guide independent learners in obtaining a world-class computer science education.

### Cooperative work

Some notes, links to community members, shoutouts etc go here.

### Goals after completion

...

## My experience, How my expectations changed etc.

After completing the requirements of the curriculum above, you will have completed the equivalent of a full bachelor's degree in Computer Science. Congratulations!

What is next for you? The possibilities are boundless and overlapping:

- Look for a job as a developer!
- Check out the [readings](extras/readings.md) for classic books you can read that will sharpen your skills and expand your knowledge.
- Join a local developer meetup (e.g. via [meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com/)).
- Pay attention to emerging technologies in the world of software development:
  + Explore the **actor model** through [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/), a new functional programming language for the web based on the battle-tested Erlang Virtual Machine!
  + Explore **borrowing and lifetimes** through [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), a systems language which achieves memory- and thread-safety without a garbage collector!
  + Explore **dependent type systems** through [Idris](https://www.idris-lang.org/), a new Haskell-inspired language with unprecedented support for type-driven development.
